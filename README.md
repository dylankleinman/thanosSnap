# thanosSnap
Project based off of a red stapler article on animating Avengers gauntlet snap dissolve and return portal using javascript
This project uses HTML/CSS, jQuery, and THREE.js for animating.  This project is not cross browser compatible, and takes a lot of memory
to run efficiently.  I have found the best animation with chrome, and this will not work in IE.
